PackOpener Class

Instance Variables:
    private int coins = 20000; //this variable represents the amount of coins the user starts the game off with
    private int playerPackChoice; //this variable represents the user's pack choice in terms of an int value
    private int playerGameChoice; //this variable represents the user's choice to continue the game in terms of an int value
    private boolean isGameOver = false; //this variable represents if the game is over in terms of a boolean value
    private boolean zeroCoins = false; //this variable represents if the user has zero coins in terms of a boolean value
    private ArrayList<String> allBronzeCards; //this variable represents the bronze cards available in terms of Strings inside of an array list
    private ArrayList<String> allSilverCards; //this variable represents the silver cards available in terms of Strings inside of an array list
    private ArrayList<String> allGoldCards; //this variable represents the gold cards available in terms of Strings inside of an array list
    private ArrayList<String> allSpecialCards; //this variable represents the special cards available in terms of Strings inside of an array list
    private ArrayList<Integer> receivedCards; //this variable represents the overall value of the packed cards inside of an array list



Constructors:
PackOpener() {}
This constructor will create the bronze, silver, gold and special lists and turn them into array lists so operations can be done on them. Also, creates the received cards array list.

PackOpener(int coins, boolean isGameOver, boolean zeroCoins)
This constructor has 3 parameters int coins, boolean isGameOver, boolean zeroCoin
This constructor will set the 3 instance variables into the specific parameters to set them to a certain value in the runner


Methods:

    public void playerPackChoice(String choice) method
    This method will use the user input 'choice' and set it to playerPackChoice to an int value, so when playerPackChoice is used as a conditional in the openPack() method, that method will know which specific pack the user wants to open

    public String openPack() method
    This method uses a playerPackChoice and coins conditionals to get a random card by using Math.random, it will also subtract the specific amount of coins given the pack chosen, and creates a substring which will be parsed to be added to an integer array list for the highestValueCard() method

    public String highestValueCard ()
    This method will use the parsed integers given by the openPack() method and will use a for loop to find the highest overall card value

    public void gameChoice(String gameChoice)
    This method will use the user input of 'gameChoice' and sets playerGameChoice to an int value, so when playerGameChoice conditional is used on isGameOver(), the computer will know if the game is over or not

    public boolean zeroCoins()
    This method will check if coins is equal to zero, and if zeroCoins = true the while loop in the runner class would end ending the game

    public boolean isGameOver()
    This method will use conditionals based on the playerGameChoice and zeroCoins values in playerPackChoice() and zeroCoins() to see if the game is over or not

    public String toString()
    This method will display the highest overall value card and the game is over message when the game is over
